# UARTs

## Introduction

From Wikipedia:
<blockquote>
A universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter (UART /ˈjuːɑːrt/) is a computer
hardware device for asynchronous serial communication in which the data format
and transmission speeds are configurable. The electric signaling levels and
methods are handled by a driver circuit external to the UART. A UART is usually
an individual (or part of an) integrated circuit (IC) used for serial
communications over a computer or peripheral device serial port. One or more
UART peripherals are commonly integrated in microcontroller chips. A related
device, the universal synchronous and asynchronous receiver-transmitter (USART)
also supports synchronous operation.

On UDOO X86 there are 2 UART ports
